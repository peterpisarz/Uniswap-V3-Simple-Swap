# Smart contract to Swap WETH for DAI
This smart contract swaps WETH for DAI using Uniswap V3. I had previously used Uniswap V2 but wanted to use the new version

The token addresses in the smart contract are on the Goerli network. Replace them with the network you're trying to swap on.

Find the SwapRouter for the network you're trying to use. Check here:
https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/deployments

Use the swap.js script to call the swap
